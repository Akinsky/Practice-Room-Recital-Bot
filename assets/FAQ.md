A: Some of our channels require extra verification, you can post a picture in #âœ‹hand-revealed to verify and get your first role.


Q: *How can I join/watch a recital?*

A: Recitals are held occassionally on Saturday's when any @Recital Manager is available. If one is coming up soon, a post tagging everyone will be made in #ðŸ“£announcement . If you're interrested in playing in one, you can use the google form link to sign up. A few things to note: For performing you will need a microphone and a piano, and by performing you consent to having your performance be streamed and recorded by the @Recital Manager for our youtube channel / viewers on Twitch.
Performers are awarded with a role to show off their past recital performances. IE: @33rd Recital @32nd Recital 
If you want to listen but not play, thats completely fine! Mark the date and time mentioned in the post in #ðŸ“£announcement and join the Recital hall voice channel or watch live on twitch. (The voice channel is only visable during a recital.) ( <https://www.twitch.tv/pinanodiscord>)
Can't make it, but really want to listen/watch? You can always watch back the recordings of *all* previous recitals on our youtube channel. ( <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdPKpkK2gQzJEqzeUFIwF-A> )
